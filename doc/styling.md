# Styling guide

## Text style

All UI elements in PMS can be styled with custom colors and text attributes.
Styles are set with the `style` command; please see the [commands documentation](commands.md#setting-styles) for details.

Colors are either literal names, such as `red`, `yellow`, or `green`, or hexadecimal color values such as `@ff0077`
(the hash sign `#` is used for comments; the `@` character is used instead).
A full list of supported color names can be found in the [tcell documentation](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/blob/master/color.go#L820).

### Tags

Any _tag_, such as `artist`, `album`, `date`, `time`, etc. can be styled.

Their styles apply both to the tracklist and in the top bar.

## Top bar

The top bar is an informational area where information about the current state of both MPD and PMS is shown.
The height and contents are very flexible, and can be made to look exactly as you want them to.

### Examples

Borders are added for emphasis, and are not part of the rendered text.

* One line, showing player state, artist, track title, and time elapsed.

  ```
  set topbar="${state|unicode} ${tag|artist} - ${tag|title} (${elapsed})"
  ```
  →
  ```
  .---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  |▶ Madrugada - Black Mambo (02:41)                                          |
  '---------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  ```

* One line, with left- and right-justified text.

  ```
  set topbar="this text is to the left|this text is to the right"
  ```
  →
  ```
  .---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  |this text is to the left                          this text is to the right|
  '---------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  ```

* Three lines containing center-justified text on the middle line.

  ```
  set topbar=";|the ${tag|artist} is in the center||;;"
  ```
  →
  ```
  .---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  |                                                                           |
  |                       the Spoonbill is in the center                      |
  |                                                                           |

  ```
